      <p>
        Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 in Zundert, Netherlands. His
        father was Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church
        and his mother was Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His interest in art began at
        a young age. As a child, he was described as serious and thoughtful. His
        early drawings were expressive but not as intense as some of his later
        works. Throughout his childhood, he felt unhappy at times, and described
        his youth as "austere and cold, and sterile".

        While at school, Van Gogh only used watercolours for his art. Around
        early 1882, most of his commissioned drawings were met with
        disappointment, since he began at an elementary level as an adult. Around
        1883, he switched to oil painting. He also began asking other well-known
        artists for technical advice. In November 1885, he visited Antwerp and
        later Paris to practise and learn more. During his stay in Paris, Van
        Gogh also experimented with a lighter palette for his artwork. He
        considered colour to have "a psychological and moral weight". Yellow
        meant the most to him because it symbolized emotional truth. Van Gogh
        aspired to be a painter of rural life and nature. He also employed
        symbolism in some of his works, as an attempt to capture the power he
        believed existed beyond the natural.

        He died on July 29, 1890, after shooting himself with a gun. He was 37
        years old.
