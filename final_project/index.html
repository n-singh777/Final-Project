      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is known for his influence on Western art. The bold colors and uninhibited brushworks, which were so common in his artworks, are believed to have set the foundations for modern art. In today’s culture, he is widely known not only for his work, but also for his personality, which has long been believed to embody the archetype of a ‘tortured artist’. </p><p id='img'><img src ='images/van_go_self_portrait.jfif'></p>
